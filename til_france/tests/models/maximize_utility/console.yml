# This is a LIAM2 simulation file. In this first example, we will see how to
# define an extremely simple simulation, how to run it and explore the results.

# Please note that any line starting with a # sign is a comment and is ignored.

# First, we define all our entities, their fields and functions (processes).
# In this case, we define only one 'person' entity, but LIAM2 can work with any
# kind of entity and any number of them.
