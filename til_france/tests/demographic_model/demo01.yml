# This is a LIAM2 simulation file. In this first example, we will see how to
# define an extremely simple simulation, how to run it and explore the results.

# Please note that any line starting with a # sign is a comment and is ignored.

# First, we define all our entities, their fields and functions (processes).
# In this case, we define only one 'person' entity, but LIAM2 can work with any
# kind of entity and any number of them.
entities:
    individus:
        fields:
            # All entities have two implicit integer fields: period and id.
            # You do not need to define them.
            - age: int
            - sexe: bool

        # Here is a list of defined functions for this entity. The actual list
        # of functions that will be executed in the simulation and in which
        # order is defined later.
        processes:
            # ageing is the name of the function
            ageing:
                # A simple process: increment the age of all persons by one.
                - age: age + 1

simulation:
    # Here comes the list of functions that will actually be
    # executed (once per simulated period). Functions and processes
    # within functions execute sequentially (the first process for all
    # individuals, then the second process, etc.). The same function may
    # appear several times in this list.
    processes:
        - individus: [ageing]

    input:
        file: input/demo.h5
    output:
        # all output files will be in the output subdirectory (this path is
        # relative to the path of the simulation file). This is optional.
        path: output
        file: simulation.h5

    # We will simulate from 2016 to 2025 (10 periods). Note that even though
    # periods correspond to years in this example, you can use any other time
    # step (days, weeks, months, ...) as long as it is an integer value. In
    # other words, you are free to interpret the period in any way you like.
    start_period: 2016
    periods: 10

# Now that we have defined our little simulation, we want to run it. If you are
# using the editor bundled with LIAM2, you can do so now by pressing F6.

# Note that LIAM2 can also be run from your system shell, by executing the
# following command line: [BUNDLEPATH]\liam2\main run demo01.yml
# However, in the rest of this tutorial (demonstration models), we will assume
# you are using the bundled editor.

# As you have seen, when a simulation is run, a console window opens within the
# editor and displays the status of the simulation. After the simulation
# completes, some statistics about the simulation are displayed and the console
# window becomes interactive. Any expression or command that can be used during
# the simulation can also be used in that interactive console.

# Let us use it to explore the results of our little simulation.
# For example, enter the following command (without the ">>>"):
#
# >>> age
#
# it should display:
#
# [66 85 66 ..., 95 57 40]
#
# which means that at the end of our simulation (in 2025), our first 3
# individuals are 66, 85 and 66 years old respectively and our last three 95,
# 57 and 40 years old. There are too many persons in our sample (10000), to
# display them all on the screen, hence this abbreviated form. The result of any
# expression can be computed:
#
# >>> age + 5
# [ 71  90  71 ..., 100  62  45]
#
# and we can also go back in time to any simulated period:

# >>> period 2020
# current period set to 2020
# >>> age
# [61 80 61 ..., 90 52 35]
# >>> age + 2
# [63 82 63 ..., 92 54 37]
#
# Feel free to play with it a bit more and when you are done, terminate the
# program by using the "q" command. If you want to explore the results again,
# without (re)simulating the model, you can press F7.

# Another way to explore the input dataset and/or the results of the simulation
# is to use an HDF5 viewer. We have bundled one (ViTables) with LIAM2. Please
# run it now by pressing F9.

# In ViTables, you should look at the "Tree of databases" column on the left,
# and expand the file you would like to inspect (eg simulation.h5),
# then expand the "entities" node, and finally double-click on the "person"
# table. This should open a sub-window in ViTables with all the data for all
# individuals for all simulated periods. After resizing that window to a more
# useful size, you can explore your data as much as you want. One very handy
# feature of ViTables that you should not miss is its ability to display
# only rows matching a particular filter (query condition). Use the "Query"
# menu, or the funnel icon on the toolbar to access it. This feature has many
# uses, from finding individuals with odd values in some fields to tracking
# particular individuals across all the periods of a simulation (e.g. with
# a "id == 42" query condition).
